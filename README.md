#R-Ladies Gives Back

R-Ladies around the world often make amazing contributions and collaborations, that directly impact the R community, but also organizations, ONGs, and other groups.

## "Gives Back" Goals
This repository aims to document all of these contributions. If we organize them, chapters can use this information to introduce R-Ladies and its work, readers and other people can know what we do and how we work with our non-R communities, and R-Ladies can have a portfolio of this activities.

## What are Contributions at "Gives Back"?
Collaborations and contributions can be a wide range of activities.
- They can be conferences, events or datathons organized by one or more chapters.
- A data analysis for an organization made by an R-Ladies chapter. This does not have to be necessarily open to the whole chapter: it can be done by a group of R-Ladies members, it can have a confidentiality arrangement, and so on.
- Workshops or training-sessions co-organized with other groups, or open to enterprises and/or organizations memebers.
- Events in which foreign speakers (i.e. non-local) were proposed by an R-Ladies chapter, but an organization helped to bring them in-person to the meeting.

## Submit Your Contribution
To submit a new contribution, please follow these steps:
1. Download the [template](/resources/Template.docx) we have available. Use a text-processor to fill all the pertinent data. Remember that it does not have to be really detailed, but it can be an overall description.
1. Convert your document to PDF, and name it `ChapterCity and [collab].pdf`. Replace the `[collab]` for the name of your event, or the organization that was involved. 
   - If several R-Ladies chapters contributed to the same event, you can: (a) put the name of a geographic region, or (b) list their names if they are up to three chapters.
1. Make a pull request (PR) uploading the document to the corresponding folder. This should be at: `contributions -> year`, where `year` is the year in which the collaboration took part.
   - If your collaboration/event started in one year, and ended on the next one, please upload _in the starting year folder_.
1. Curators of the **Gives Back** repo will double check your submission, and either request changes or accept it.

### Unsure About Submitting?
