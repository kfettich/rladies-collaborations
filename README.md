# R-Ladies Collaborations

R-Ladies around the world often works with organizations, ONGs, and other groups, producing contributions, participation, involvement or associations of talks, workshops, projects, conference, etc. Through such collaborations R-Ladies impacts the R community as well as non-R communities.

## Goals
This repository aims to document all of these collaborations. There are three main goals for this repository:
1. This repository aims to capture these R-Ladies collaborations in a single portfolio.
1. R-Ladies chapters can use this information to introduce R-Ladies and its work.
1. Readers and other people can see what we do and how we work with our R and non-R communities.

## What are Contributions?
Collaborations and contributions can be a wide range of activities.
- They can be conferences, events or datathons organized by one or more chapters.
- A data analysis for an organization made by an R-Ladies chapter. This does not have to be necessarily open to the whole chapter: it can be done by a group of R-Ladies members, it can have a confidentiality arrangement, and so on.
- Workshops or training-sessions co-organized with other groups, or open to enterprises and/or organizations members.
- Events in which foreign speakers (i.e. non-local) were proposed by an R-Ladies chapter, but an organization helped to bring them in-person to the meeting.

## Submit Your Contribution
To submit a new contribution, please follow these steps:
1. Download the template we have available. Use a text-processor to fill all the pertinent data. Remember that it does not have to be really detailed, but it can be an overall description.
   - Template: [DOCX File](/resources/Template.docx) or [ODT File](/resources/Template.odt)
1. Convert your document to PDF, and name it `ChapterCity and [thirdParty].pdf`. Replace the `[thirdParty]` for the name of your event, the organization or people involved. 
   - If several R-Ladies chapters contributed to the same event, you can: (a) put the name of a geographic region, or (b) list their names if they are up to three chapters.
1. Make a pull request (PR) uploading the document to the corresponding folder. This should be at: `contributions -> year`, where `year` is the year in which the collaboration took part.
   - If your collaboration/event started in one year, and ended on the next one, please upload _in the starting year folder_.
1. Curators of the **Collaborations** repo will double check your submission, and either request changes or accept it.

### Unsure About Submitting?
If you are unsure if something is a contribution, you can make an issue on the repository, or you can contact current curators on both the _R-Ladies Global_ Slack, or at _R-Ladies Community_ Slack.
