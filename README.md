# R-Ladies Gives Back

R-Ladies chapters around the world often make contributions through collaborations, that directly impact the R community, not-for-profit organizations, ONGs, or other groups.

## Goal or this repository
This repository aims to document all these collaborations into a list of contributions, which can be used to inform others about the activities of R-Ladies. 

## What kind of contributions do we include?
Collaborations and contributions can be a wide range of activities. For example:
- They can be conferences, events or hackathons/datathons organized by one or more R-Ladies chapters.
- Workshops or training-sessions co-organized with other groups, or open to enterprises and/or organizations members.
- A data analysis for a not-for-profit organization made by an R-Ladies chapter *(add link to an example)*. This does not have to be necessarily open to the whole chapter: it can be done by a group of R-Ladies members, it can have a confidentiality arrangement, and so on.
- Events in which foreign speakers (i.e. non-local) were proposed by an R-Ladies chapter, but an organization helped to bring them in-person to the meeting.

## Submit your contribution
To submit a new contribution, please follow these steps:
1. Download the [template](/resources/Template.docx) we have available. Use a text-processor to fill all the pertinent data. Remember that it does not have to be really detailed, but it can be an overall description.
2. Convert your document to PDF, and name it `ChapterCity and [collab].pdf`. Replace the `[collab]` for the name of your event, or the organization that was involved. 
   - If several R-Ladies chapters contributed to the same event, you can: (a) put the name of a geographic region, or (b) list their names if they are up to three chapters.
3. Make a pull request (PR) uploading the document to the corresponding folder. This should be at: `contributions -> year`, where `year` is the year in which the collaboration took part.
   - If your collaboration/event started in one year, and ended on the next one, please upload _in the starting year folder_.
4. Curators of the **Gives Back** repo will double check your submission, and either request changes or accept it.

### Unsure About Submitting?
If you are unsure if something is a contribution, file an issue *(link to issues)*, or you can contact the current curators on both the _R-Ladies Global_ Slack, or at _R-Ladies Community_ Slack.
